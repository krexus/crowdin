crowdin_sync.py
==================

Introduction
------------
This script is used to synchronize Krexus's translations with Crowdin's. Also, it can handle
automatic commiting to Github and pushing/downloading to/from Crowdin.

Prerequisites
-------------
The Ruby variant of crowdin-cli is required for this to work.

    \curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
    source /home/your_username/.rvm/scripts/rvm # Add this to your .bashrc file!
    rvm all do gem install crowdin-cli

python-git is used for Git integration.

    sudo apt-get install python-git

Executing
---------
Export the following environment variables to set the API keys and the base path.
Base path should contain all Krexus trees in subfolders, named after Krexus branches:

    export CROWDIN_API_KEY=your_api_key
    export CROWDIN_BASE_PATH=your_base_path

Execute:

    ./crowdin_sync.py --username your_github_username --branch branch_name [--no-download|--no-upload]

Bugs
----
 - When committing fails, the reason of it cannot be determined. Often this is just when there
   are no new translations, so the script will not exit when this happens.
